## Configuration Overview

**Sip I/O**  API version is currently `v1draft1`. We will continue to improve the API, resource definition, and other artifacts until we reach a beta version. We will then establish an update policy to ensure backward compatibility. The configuration files are beautifully implemented using YAML(inspired by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)) so this might be familiar to you. Here is an example of a `Domain` configuration:

```yml
- apiVersion: v1draft1
  kind: Domain
  metadata:
    name: Sip Local
  spec:
    context:
      domainUri: sip.local
      egressPolicy:
        rule: .*
        didRef: DID0001
      accessControlList:
        deny: [0.0.0.0/1]     # Deny all
        allow: [192.168.0.1/31]
```

## Running the Server :up:
